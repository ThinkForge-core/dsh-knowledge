# Changelog

## 0.4.1 — 2026-09-22

### MinerU failures are recoverable (issue #30)

- **A failed MinerU import can be rebuilt.** A scanned PDF whose MinerU extraction failed *and* whose local fallback failed left a placeholder row holding the raw PDF but no `rawText` and no chunks; rebuilding that row then reported `has no source text to reindex`, with no way out of the state. Import, single-document rebuild and crash recovery now all go through one extraction chain, so rebuilding such a row retries MinerU and can recover. A PDF configured for MinerU keeps using MinerU on rebuild instead of silently degrading to local parsing, an aborted (deleted) document passes the abort through instead of pointlessly running the local parser, and a MinerU import interrupted by a crash can be resumed at startup.
- **Both failure reasons are reported.** MinerU's own failure was only written to the log, while the row showed the local parser's complaint — which is why a runtime MinerU problem (key, quota, network, API response) looked like a parser defect. A double failure now raises `MinerU extraction failed (...); local parsing failed (...)`, so the actionable reason reaches the user. Neither the MinerU client nor the import pipeline changed behaviourally since it was introduced; what was missing was a way out after a runtime failure.
- Recovery retries are bounded, so a permanently failing source cannot be retried forever.

### Deferred audit items closed

The 0.4.0 audit recorded six smaller findings as deliberately deferred. Five of them are fixed in this release:

- `rawTextLimit` is clamped. A negative value used to reach `rawText.slice(0, rawTextLimit)` and silently drop the tail of the document instead of capping the payload.
- `GET /knowledge/stats?baseId=<unknown>` answers **404** instead of a plausible-looking all-zero summary.
- Chunking no longer emits an empty chunk when a window boundary lands on whitespace.
- `src/knowledge/context.ts` is no longer bundled twice: the shared part lives in `context-protocol.ts`, which both host entries import.
- `scripts/stress-auto-retrieve.mts` is inside the typecheck.
- The retrieval benchmark runs against a throwaway `DSH_HOME` rather than the developer's real profile.

`docs/audit-0.4-deferred-findings.md` is updated to match; the one remaining deferred item is moving mupdf page rendering off the host thread.

### Quality

- 353 tests across 26 files, including a new `tests/mineru-recovery.spec.ts`; the preflight (typecheck, retrieval benchmark, deterministic build, package verification, production audit policy, worker-bundle protocol smoke) and CI on Node 22.19 / 24 / 26 across Ubuntu, Windows and macOS all pass.
- Thanks to [InfiniteScope](https://github.com/InfiniteScope) for PRs #27–#29 and #31.

## 0.4.0 — 2026-09-15

### One directory source, one sync path (issue #20)

- **Idempotent re-import**: a directory source is now identified by its base plus its canonical real path. Importing the same directory again synchronizes the original tree in place instead of creating a second root. Manual directories with no live source keep their previous organizational meaning, and the base-wide background reindex no longer skips tracked roots.
- **Truthful sync results**: every import and directory reindex returns per-item `created` / `updated` / `unchanged` / `deleted` / `failed` outcomes with relative paths, and an aggregate `synced` / `unchanged` / `partial` status. Unchanged files are never reported as failures, and a sync that succeeds for most files while some fail returns `partial` with the successful work retained.
- **Path-based identity**: directory children are matched by their actual source path. A legacy child with no stored path is adopted only when its name and kind are unique; two candidates are reported as `ambiguous_source` rather than resolved by a first-match guess. A tree that the old behaviour already duplicated is never merged, moved, or auto-deleted — the user inspects and removes it.
- **Live reindex identity**: files imported from a directory retain `sourcePath`, so a single-file reindex re-reads the file from disk instead of replaying the stored snapshot. `sourcePath` is exposed on administrative document summaries and details, and is never included in model-facing search results.
- **Resolved path identity**: every stored local source path is now the resolved real path, whether the source arrived as a directory tree, a single file, or a repoint. macOS reaches its temp directory through the `/var` symlink and Windows paths may go through a junction or a short name, so comparing the spelling a user typed would let one file become two sources. The management panel therefore displays the resolved path.

### Explicit destructive deletes

- **Delete impact preview**: `GET /knowledge/documents/:id/delete-impact` reports the directories, files, chunks, and durable raw snapshots a delete would remove, and whether an explicit confirmation is required.
- **Recursive confirmation**: deleting a non-empty directory now fails with `recursive_confirmation_required` unless the caller passes `recursive: true`. The management panel fetches the impact first and shows a second confirmation listing the exact scope; the `knowledge_delete_document` tool exposes the same `recursive` argument. A batch delete preflights every selected root before any write, so a missing confirmation can never leave a partially deleted batch.

### Local model lifecycle and retrieval status (issues #16–#18)

- **Retrieval reports the lanes that ran** (issue #16). `mode` is derived from which lanes executed, not from whether one result row happened to carry both scores — RRF legitimately admits single-lane rows, so a search whose vector lane contributed used to report `mode: "lexical"`. Lane-level `attempted`/`succeeded`/`returnedCount` and a `scoreKind` naming what the scores mean are both returned. The row-derived fallback is gone rather than kept as a default.
- **Rerank readiness reflects the model, not a flag** (issue #18). A routine model load no longer publishes `validating` (that masqueraded as a verification and re-armed the gate's veto for concurrent searches), child teardown clears the status it owned, and a flag whose owner is gone expires instead of vetoing every later search — which was self-locking, because the gate refused the very request that would have posted `ready`. A gate refusal now reports the new `skipped` status with no elapsed time instead of `degraded` with `attempted: false`, and a cold child gets an explicit load allowance so its model load is not charged to the query's inference budget.
- **A broken local model no longer requires restarting DSH** (issue #17). A failure the child reports about itself now replaces that child, so the automatic retry is a real restart rather than a no-op inside the same poisoned process; a truncated or unloadable cache is quarantined and re-downloaded instead of being reported as present forever.
- **Download integrity and cancel semantics.** Weights completeness is judged against the byte size the downloader itself reported, not "a non-empty `.onnx` exists". Cancelling a download stops only an in-flight transfer — it never deletes a complete, validated model — and a download is not tied to the HTTP request that started it, so a client disconnect does not cancel it. The request budget is re-armed by progress, so a slow link is bounded by a stall rather than by total transfer time.

### Data integrity

- **A completed import no longer keeps its crash marker.** The pre-embedding write marks a document resumable; the completing write used to spread that record back, so every imported document stayed marked and startup recovery treated the whole library as interrupted — re-parsing and re-embedding it on the next start with auto-resume on, and re-marking every document failed on every start with auto-resume off. The decision not to resume now also clears the marker.
- **Chunk rows left by a delete are reconciled.** A batch that landed after its document row was deleted kept matching lexical and vector search (the lanes scope by base, not by document existence); startup and every delete now remove them, and the mid-embedding guard deletes the rows it already wrote.

### Storage resilience

- **A storage failure is reported, not hidden.** `openStore` fell back to an in-memory store on ANY failure, including one after the SQLite file and the domain were already open: the user saw an EMPTY library while the data sat intact on disk, every write that session was lost on restart, and both handles leaked. Only an absent backend falls back now; anything else closes what it opened and throws `StorageUnavailableError`, which the HTTP layer answers as `503 storage_unavailable`.
- **Deletes are durable before they report success** — the store dropped the batched, yielding delete's promise, so a document row could be gone while its chunks were still there.
- **The FTS migration is transactional and guarded by a marker** rather than by schema text. An interruption between `CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE` and `rebuild` used to leave an empty index that the textual guard accepted, skipping the rebuild forever and silently emptying the lexical lane for all pre-existing content. (FTS5's own `integrity-check` cannot detect that state: measured, it accepts an empty index on an external-content table.)
- Space reclamation is best-effort as documented (a failing checkpoint or `VACUUM` used to turn a successful delete into a reported failure), the legacy JSON migration resumes per document instead of skipping wholesale, concurrent settings writes no longer clobber each other, and the per-base vector cache is invalidated by `PRAGMA data_version` so another connection's commits are visible.

### Security

- **IPv6 hosts no longer bypass the URL-import guard.** The deny-list held bracketed literals (`[::1]`, `[::]`) while the lookup stripped the brackets first, so those entries could never match and NO IPv6 form was rejected — including `http://[::ffff:127.0.0.1]:11434/`. Literal addresses are classified with `isIP` now, covering loopback, unspecified, unique-local, link-local and multicast IPv6, IPv4-mapped forms in both notations, and the CGNAT, benchmarking, multicast and reserved IPv4 ranges.
- **Private evaluation sets cannot ship.** The template told users to put their real question set in `scripts/`, which is published; the same leak is recorded for 0.2.12. Sets live in the git-ignored `eval/` directory now, and `verify-package` rejects a non-example set in the tarball.

### Truthful reporting in the API and the panel

- Directory imports and rescans report the real diff. `imported` counts created **and** updated items, so a re-sync that re-parsed every changed file no longer answers `imported: 0`; the panel shows created/updated/deleted/unchanged/failed and says "no changes detected" instead of "0 documents", and names the first failure when a sync is only partly successful.
- A batch delete reports the documents actually removed (the confirmation dialog and the result used to describe the same action with different numbers — one directory holding 200 files was confirmed as N and reported as 1).
- `reindexBase` collects per-root failures instead of aborting the whole sweep on one unreadable source, the reindex job exposes the base size alongside its root count, and repointing a directory source refuses a path another root already owns.
- Client mistakes answer 400 rather than 500 (and a malformed body no longer answers 404 "no route"), an import whose every attempt failed reports the engine's reason instead of telling the user to download models they already have, and OCR work is bounded by a 15-minute budget and a cumulative raster cap on the render path as well as the fallback.

### Panel behaviour

- The local-models poll no longer erases action messages (it cleared the shared slot every second, so a failed download showed no reason), success text is no longer styled as an error, clearing a numeric field no longer saves an invalid `0`, a failed rename/create can be retried without closing the dialog, file-import failures always surface, adding a note refreshes the list, and the directory-import toast no longer claims success next to an error.

### Compatibility and quality

- The release is additive and migration-free: 0.3.9 data directories start without a database migration, re-embedding, forced reindex, legacy directory cleanup, or model download. Existing fields and call signatures keep working; the sync result, `sourcePath` accessor, delete-impact preview, `recursive` argument, per-lane retrieval status, `scoreKind`, and the `skipped` rerank status are additions. The one deliberate tightening is that a non-empty directory can no longer be deleted silently.
- Installing and recovering a DSH profile is documented in both READMEs (issue #22).
- **Every emitted companion bundle is now executed by a gate.** The embed, rerank and OCR child implementations exist only as build artifacts, and the suites that appeared to cover them replaced `node:child_process` wholesale, so nothing ran them. `npm run smoke:workers` forks or loads each bundle and requires a real protocol exchange; it runs in the quality job, on every native platform, and in the release preflight.
- The suite pins vitest's `forks` pool. The `threads` pool was measured to crash whole runs with an access violation (2 of 4) because this suite loads native addons; forks passed 6 of 6 and is what CI runs.
- When the durable backend exists but cannot be opened, the failure is reported instead of an empty library (`503 storage_unavailable`).
- Full typecheck, the complete Vitest suite, the deterministic build, package verification, production audit policy, and the retrieval benchmark are part of the release preflight; cross-platform CI and the real local embedding/rerank smoke run before the tag.

### PDF parsing can no longer leak a host-level rejection

- `pdf-parse` v1 bundles pdf.js v1.10, whose failure path leaks an unhandled rejection: `getDocument` throws before the library's local `doc` is ever assigned, so its unawaited `doc.destroy()` never runs and the half-built worker leaves a promise rejecting with nobody attached. Node 22 escalates that stray rejection to a process-level unhandled rejection, so importing a scanned or corrupt PDF reported an unhandled error in the host process — and failed CI on Node 22.19 while every assertion still passed.
- pdf-parse now runs in its own worker thread, the same containment the OCR worker already uses for Tesseract.js and the embed/rerank processes use for onnxruntime. The stray rejection is recorded in that thread with a bounded, prefixed message and never reaches the host; the caller still receives a clean parse failure and falls through to pdfjs-dist layout extraction, OCR, and anydoc exactly as before.
- A per-request ceiling means a PDF the engine cannot finish reports a clear failure instead of pinning an import indefinitely, and an install missing the worker bundle logs one warning and parses in-process rather than hanging.

## 0.3.9 — 2026-09-02

### Local-path import and source tracking

- **Import by absolute path**: the knowledge panel can import one local file or a complete directory tree while retaining the originating path on every top-level source. Directory rescans discover new files, update changed files, and remove vanished files without conflating separate roots.
- **Targeted source repointing**: changing a source path now targets exactly one selected top-level file or directory. The service rejects relative paths, cross-base ids, nested children, path-kind mismatches, and non-file/directory sources instead of guessing which source to update.
- **Correct reindex identity**: a repointed file is read from its new path and parsed using its new extension. Mixed file/directory bases keep independent source identities, and source summaries expose stable ids for unambiguous UI updates.
- **Collision- and failure-safe raw storage**: two directory roots containing the same relative path receive distinct raw copies. A failed replacement reindex retains the previous committed raw bytes, while successful replacement removes only the superseded copy. Partial directory imports return their per-file errors to the UI.

### Ollama and interface polish

- **Ollama empty-URL fallback**: an empty Ollama embedding URL now uses `http://127.0.0.1:11434`; OpenAI-compatible providers continue to require an explicit endpoint. Regression coverage protects the provider-specific behavior.
- **Explicit model settings**: browsing or pulling Ollama models no longer changes the configured embedding provider/model implicitly.
- **Popover and theme hardening**: root and nested portal popovers stay inside the viewport, close consistently, and use the shared theme tokens. Toast dismissal and model-setting behavior are protected by UI policy tests.
- **Localization**: Chinese and English strings cover local-path import, source tracking, partial failures, and the integrated UI states.

### Compatibility and quality

- The release is additive and migration-free: v0.3.8 databases, chunks, embeddings, retrieval contracts, and existing upload/URL import flows remain valid. No automatic reindex or model download is triggered.
- The integration preserves the original ThinkForge-core author commits from PRs #10–#13 and layers maintainer safety fixes and regression tests as separate commits.
- Full typecheck, 322-test Vitest suite, retrieval benchmark v2, production audit policy, deterministic build, npm package verification, and Windows local-path filesystem scenarios pass before release.

## 0.3.8 — 2026-08-31

### Retrieval execution and automatic retrieval

- **One bounded rerank path**: `KnowledgeService.search(request, execution?)` keeps configured reranking for normal callers, while proactive retrieval explicitly skips service-level rerank. The first-token path never starts a local cross-encoder; a configured remote reranker may run once with no retries inside the remaining part of one four-second deadline. Provider timeout, crash, and failure preserve lexical order; owner cancellation exits immediately without injecting evidence or mutating retrieval memory.
- **Follow-up-aware query planning**: the current turn always survives the 200-character query budget (head + tail). Short/deictic follow-ups may add one history-aware lexical query; the two rankings are fused with RRF. Already injected evidence is removed before rerank and per-base seat allocation, so same-topic turns can contribute one fresh item instead of being blocked before search.
- **Stricter routing and identifiers**: explicitly naming a base that has proactive retrieval disabled or weight 0 no longer falls through to unrelated bases. Exact numeric/model/version/error identifiers use a boundary-aware path and must remain present in the final visible evidence.
- **Consistent lexical/filter contracts**: short-query LIKE fallback now returns a deterministic positive score (`1024 / (1024 + searchTextLength)`), fixing two-character CJK automatic retrieval. `docIds: undefined` means unrestricted; an explicit empty allow-list matches no documents in both service and SQLite lexical/vector lanes.

### Ordered evidence windows

- **Additive `ContextWindow` API**: every new search hit carries ordered, token-bounded `before`, `anchor`, and `after` excerpts with chunk ids/indexes, heading paths, chunk-relative UTF-16 ranges, truncation flags, estimated tokens, and continuation flags. `SearchHit.text` remains the complete canonical anchor; deprecated `siblingContext` remains available throughout 0.3.x.
- **One context composer**: reranking, explicit search rendering, proactive previews, and benchmark evaluation share the same document-order serializer. Context stops at heading changes by default, centres oversized anchors on the query, removes exact adjacent overlap, and keeps anchor evidence authoritative. Context is composed at query time; no bridge text is persisted or embedded.
- **Stable degradation**: single- and multi-query results use the same contextual rerank input and stable tie ordering. Invalid/empty rerank output leaves the original retrieval order and its evidence windows intact.

### Anchored reading and tool output

- **Direct continuation from a hit**: `knowledge_search` exposes `chunkIndex` and one continuation hint. `knowledge_get_document` retains page mode but now uses true SQL limit/offset; passing exactly one of `anchorChunkId` or `anchorIndex` selects context mode with bounded `before`, `after`, `maxTokens`, `focus`, and `crossHeading` controls. Stale, disabled, or document-mismatched anchors fail explicitly.
- **Visible offsets**: regular-expression results from `knowledge_read_document` render `charStart`/`charEnd` and include a copyable continuation instruction for reading around the first match.

### Evaluation, release, and compatibility

- **Benchmark schema v2**: the committed bilingual 24-document/40-question synthetic fixture now gates model-visible evidence recall, automatic-retrieval output, context order, and token budgets in addition to Hit@1/3, Recall@3, MRR, and legacy context recall. Its committed 0.3.8 baseline records 100% ContextWindow coverage, 100% visible-evidence recall/Bridge@1, and zero ordering or budget violations. A dedicated bridge fixture requires an answer absent from the top anchor to survive both its serialized window and a real `getDocumentContext(anchorChunkId)` continuation; this remains a deterministic service contract, not a claim about a live model autonomously completing the tool trajectory or about private-corpus accuracy. Duplicate-token ratio and latency remain informational.
- **Version-independent release verification**: release metadata checks derive the version from `package.json`, validate the matching manifest, changelog heading, release-note file/heading, and optional Git tag, and include a dependency-free self-test in `release:check`.
- **Migration-free upgrade**: 0.3.7 databases, chunks, embeddings, `SearchHit.text`, and page-mode calls remain valid. No database migration, automatic reindex, or extra embedding work is introduced.
- **Explicit deferrals**: this release does not claim to solve cross-base mixed embedding spaces, stale-vector signatures, semantic-chunk centroid/final-text embedding correctness, or Issue #6 smart-chunk fragmentation/aggregation.

## 0.3.7 — 2026-08-30

### Local reranking (cross-encoder) hardening

- **独立 rerank 进程**：本地交叉编码器（bge-reranker-base 等）从 embed worker 迁出为 `fork` 的专用进程（`rerank-process.mjs`），host 不再 import——每次启动是全新进程空间，从架构上消除「同进程重复加载 onnxruntime 绑定」类问题；进程协议版本化（`rerank-protocol`），Runner 支持模型热切换、批量推理与 dispose。
- **冒烟自测**：`scripts/smoke-local-rerank.mjs` 对真实模型跑判别性自测（`scores[0] > scores[1]`），覆盖初始启动与进程恢复两轮；CI 新增手动触发的 `local-rerank-smoke` job（Ubuntu + 模型缓存 + Node 22.19/24），补上 Linux 真实模型验证路径。

### UI

- **完整 chunk 预览**：文档阅读面板可展开完整 chunk 内容（不再截断到检索片段），便于核验检索命中上下文。

### CI & release tooling

- **打包冒烟生命周期**：`smoke-packed-lifecycle`（安装 → 启动 → 卸载全流程监督）+ 卸载超时分类（部分卸载 vs 完整失败）；原生集成超时放宽。
- 发布预检链（release:check）保持不变，含构建策略、审计、测试、基准、打包验证。

### 测试

- 全量单元测试、检索基准（Hit@1 ≥ 95%）、发布预检在发布前全部通过。

## 0.3.6 — 2026-08-30

### Retrieval and safety

- **Strict enabled-base boundary**: automatic retrieval and every model tool now share the same fail-closed scope. An explicit empty or all-stale selection exposes no bases instead of silently widening to all bases; per-base `autoRetrieve` and weight overrides are persisted and enforced.
- **Safer proactive context**: only the current user turn controls topic gating and base-name routing, while recent turns are used solely to enrich the query. Injected chunks are clearly framed as untrusted evidence, carry stable base/document/chunk identifiers, and sanitize source metadata onto one bounded line.
- **Multi-query rank fusion**: the primary query plus at most three normalized, deduplicated variants are fused with Reciprocal Rank Fusion, then reranked at most once. Reported totals are no longer multiplied by the number of variants.
- **Tool guardrails and output completeness**: permanent base/document deletion requires host approval; search enum/range validation is strict; document reads are paged and report continuation/truncation state; native search output emits each excerpt once while preserving canonical structured citations.

### Tests

- Added regression coverage for stale/empty scope, per-base automatic retrieval controls, context-topic separation, source framing, RRF normalization and rerank count, destructive approval classification, and paged native rendering.

### Release engineering

- **Cross-platform CI**: Node 22.19/24 quality lanes, Windows/Linux/macOS native lanes, and packed-tarball installation/boot smoke tests against a pinned DSH compatibility anchor.
- **Clean-install build policy**: explicitly approved esbuild's required install script and added a dependency-free pre-install validator so local caches cannot conceal unresolved native build decisions.
- **Production audit policy**: the one current transitive `sharp` advisory is explicitly documented, reachability-scoped, expiry-bound, and machine-checked; any new high/critical advisory fails CI.
- **Reproducible retrieval benchmark**: a committed bilingual synthetic corpus and question set gate Hit@1/3, Recall@3, MRR, and context recall without network access or model downloads; latency and RSS remain informational.
- **Release and contributor hygiene**: package verification, a no-publish release preflight, SECURITY/CONTRIBUTING guidance, structured issue templates, a PR checklist, release notes, and a copy-ready issue #5 response.

## 0.3.5 — Linux local-worker lifecycle fix

### Fixes

- **Linux 本地嵌入重载修复**：空闲超时不再终止并重建 embedding worker；worker 仅调用 `pipeline.dispose()` / `model.dispose()` 卸载 ONNX session 后继续存活，避免 `onnxruntime-node` 在同一进程的第二个 worker isolate 中报 `Module did not self-register`。模型释放与后续加载串行执行，下一次请求从磁盘在同一 worker 内重载。
- **全局空闲超时设置**：`localWorkerIdleTimeoutMs`（默认 60000，0=模型常驻）改为真正的全局持久化设置，并移至「设置 → 本地模型」；修改正数值会立即重置现有计时器。
- **准确的故障提示**：模型文件在盘但本地运行时启动失败时，提示重启服务或检查运行时，不再误导用户重新下载完好的模型。

## 0.3.4 — Auto-retrieve (NexusRAG-style) (npm release, pending)

### Auto-retrieve

- **自动预检索**：用户消息到达 agent 时**无需显式调用知识库工具**即自动检索并注入相关背景（NexusRAG 风格）。事件接线走 `agent/inbox/claimed`，注入为 user-role 消息（source=dsh-knowledge），持久进会话日志。
- **自适应相关闸门**：绝对底线（BM25 0.12 / rerank 0.3）+ 领先比（top1 ≥ 1.2× 次高）+ 组界（0.6×top1），弱匹配/闲聊/数学题不注入。
- **强并列不再误杀**（本次修复）：领先闸门原本无条件要求 top1 明显领先次高——当多份文档覆盖同一话题（如 0.91/0.89 强并列）时会把完全相关的命中整体吞掉。现在 top1 超过底线 2× 即视为「强命中」，跳过领先闸门（与 rerank 路径一致），组界 + 每库座位仍约束其余块。
- **噪声输入防线**（本次修复）：入口不再按原始文本长度截断（符号占位曾让「报销流程？」这类 5-7 字符有效短查询永不检索）；改为清洗后的三重信号门——非空 topic 信号、至少一个 CJK 2-gram 或 ≥3 字母单词、非重复型填充（好的好的好的/哈哈哈哈 等单字/双字/三字重复不再触发检索）。纯符号、标点、表情、闲聊、裸数字（12345678）、裸版本号（v1.2.3）一律不检索；「2024-01-01 是什么日子」这类含真实意图词的仍正常检索。
- **Rerank 参与预检索**：配置远程 rerank 模型时先按 BM25 取 12 候选，rerank 重排序后注入；`local:` 模型跳过（每消息加载 ~280MB 过重），rerank 失败降级 BM25。
- **按库权重**：`autoRetrieveWeight`（0–5，默认 3，0=排除该库）作为每库座位上限；高权重库可主导注入，weight-0 库完全不参与。配套 `autoRetrieve` 总开关（默认开），RAG 设置面板 + 中英文案齐备。
- **话题感知节流**：同一 agent 5 分钟内同话题追问跳过（避免上下文堆积），新话题立即放行；通用 2-gram（什么/怎么/如何…）不参与话题判定。
- **注入去重**：per-agent chunk-id 记忆（上限 50，溢出重置），同一块不重复注入；单条注入 ≤3 块、每块 ≤300 字符裁剪，带 `[库名 / 标题 / heading]` 前缀。
- **追问上下文**：拼接最近 2 轮用户消息做检索查询（指代消解）；库名定向（消息含库名则只搜该库）。
- **压力测试**：`scripts/stress-auto-retrieve.mts` 真实 KnowledgeService + SQLite，30 项端到端检查（事实问答/追问/换话题/闲聊/数学/库名定向/跨库/去重/截断/弱匹配/10 连发/8 并发/weight-0 排除/weight-1 座位上限 + 默认权重对照）。

### Dependencies

- **安装下载面减半**：移除冗余的 `tesseract.js-core ^6.1.2` 直接依赖（tesseract.js@7 自带 core 7.0.0，旧版 43MB 白下载）；`onnxruntime-node` 从 `^1.27.0`（解析到 1.29.0，296MB）改为与 `@huggingface/transformers` 对齐的**精确 `1.21.0`**（218MB，transformers 官方 pin 并测试的版本）——原来两个版本并存 = 双份 ~514MB 原生库下载，现在依赖图单一版本，新装用户下载量约减半。

## 0.3.3 — local-model status fix (npm release, pending)

### Fixes

- **本地模型状态误报修复**：`getLocalModelStatus` 只查询进程内存的下载/加载记录，模型在磁盘上（例如迁移或重启后从未惰性加载）会误报「未就绪」；现在内存无记录时回退**磁盘探测**（权重文件在盘即视为就绪，加载仍惰性）。迁移到新缓存目录后状态查询自动跟随新位置（无需重启）。

## 0.3.2 — Cherry Studio deep-alignment (npm release, pending)

### Retrieval & storage

- **Token-budget chunking** (Cherry's splitter semantics): `chunkSize` /
  `chunkOverlap` are now token budgets converted per document via the
  measured chars-per-token ratio (CJK ~1.5, latin ~4); long blocks cut at
  Cherry's break-point model (heading 100 → code edge 80 → rule 60 →
  paragraph 20 → sentence 8 → list 5 → newline 1, distance-decayed inside
  the 22% window). Defaults raised to 1024/200 (Cherry's).
- **FTS VACUUM fix**: `chunk_fts` keys on a stable `fts_rowid` surrogate
  (trigger-assigned) instead of the implicit rowid, which VACUUM renumbers —
  large deletes no longer silently desync lexical retrieval (Cherry's
  #16132-class fix); existing stores migrate in place.
- **Rerank semantics** (Cherry's mergeRerankResults): only candidates the
  rerank model returned survive the step (top_n = final topK), so relevance
  scores never mix with raw BM25/cosine scores; 401/403/404 log at error.
- **similarityThreshold applies to pure-vector mode** too (Cherry's
  scoreKind semantics).
- **BM25 polish**: short-term LIKE filters relax when they eliminate every
  candidate; the pure-LIKE fallback ANDs one filter per token and orders by
  text length; MAX_MATCH_TERMS=64 caps long CJK queries; zero-norm vectors
  never outrank real hits.
- **Embedding batch retries**: 3 attempts with exponential backoff (1s→30s)
  before an import degrades to lexical-only (Cherry's job retry contract).

### Lifecycle & reliability

- **Delete × in-flight race fixed**: deleting a document/base invalidates
  its indexing tasks and every finishing write re-checks the row/base still
  exist — a queued or running import can no longer resurrect a deleted row
  or write chunks under a deleted base (Cherry's deleting-guard).
- **Cancel chain**: an AbortController per ingest task aborts in-flight
  embedding HTTP requests and MinerU batches when the document/base is
  deleted; MinerU timeout raised to 30 minutes.
- **Batch conflict detection** (Cherry's addItems detect): the new
  `addFiles` API reports every collision (existing + batch-internal) in one
  authoritative round without adding; clean detects add the whole batch
  atomically.
- **resumeInterruptedOnStartup config**: off marks interrupted imports
  failed instead of auto re-embedding (Cherry: a deliberate quit must not
  re-spend the embedding API).
- **Directory imports persist raw copies** of every supported file under
  tree-relative paths, so a base stays rebuildable if the source disk
  changes (Cherry's prepare-root copy).
- **Error codes**: failed documents carry `errorCode`
  (interrupted / dimension_mismatch / parse_failed / embedding_provider)
  with UI-localized copy and rebuild guidance (Cherry's code→i18n posture).
- **Progress linger**: a finished job's final percentage stays visible for
  ~60s; enable-in-place (BM25→model) refuses while documents are indexing
  or a document has no rebuildable source.

### Parsing & deep-read

- **HTML→Markdown via turndown** (headings/lists/links/code/tables survive
  for the heading-aware chunker; nav/footer/aside/form chrome stripped),
  used by URL import/refresh, .html/.htm files and EPUB pages.
- **Deep-read guards** (Cherry's KnowledgeConceptService): readDocumentText
  caps one slice at 20k chars; grepDocument scans one 2000-char line at a
  time (catastrophic-backtracking patterns can no longer freeze the host)
  and reports a full-document totalMatches.

### UI

- **Local embedding model status**: live 800ms header label + empty-state
  progress ring/guidance with a go-to-settings button.
- **Dimension probe**: saving a changed embedding model (or rebuilding via
  the restore dialog) probes the vector width first; the restore dialog now
  offers an optional model switch with a pre-commit probe.
- **Text (note) add entry**: title + content dialog using the existing host
  `addTextDocument`.
- **Conflict dialog**: lists the colliding file names; resolution buttons
  show loading and the dialog cannot close mid-resolution.
- **File picker**: over 20 files rejects the whole batch (was silent
  truncation); drag-drop filters unsupported extensions and caps the batch.
- **Failed rows** show localized reason labels with a focusable, aria-
  labelled badge; pending rows show 等待中; end-of-list marker after 100
  rows.

## 0.3.1 — Full-project audit fixes + AGPL-3.0 relicensing (npm release, 2026-08-20)

### License

- Project relicensed **MIT → AGPL-3.0**: PDF page rendering depends on
  mupdf (AGPL-3.0), whose copyleft applies to distributions containing it;
  AGPL-3.0 keeps the whole project legally self-consistent (and matches the
  license of its design inspiration, Cherry Studio). LICENSE, package.json
  and both READMEs updated.

### Bug fixes (full-project audit round 3, 23 fixes)

- True cosine (L2-normalized, NaN-safe) in the vector lane and semantic
  chunk merging — non-unit vectors no longer collapse all top scores to 1.0;
  `chunkStats` model counts scoped to the requested bases; empty queries no
  longer return the whole corpus; >500 docId filters throw instead of
  silently truncating; chunk deletes scoped by base id; code fences keep
  their opener length (4+ backticks close correctly); NaN chunk parameters
  guarded.
- XLSX parsing honors cell `t=` types (numbers/dates no longer misread as
  shared-string indices) and joins rich-text shared strings per `<si>`;
  GBK/GB18030 text decode fallback; lone surrogates rejected.
- OCR: per-image (32MP) and per-PDF (512MB) raster caps (forged dimension
  headers can no longer OOM the process); per-page fault isolation; CJK
  lines no longer glued across newlines; hung-worker watchdog respawns
  after consecutive timeouts; tesseract fallback un-poisons itself; page
  destroy in finally.
- UI: per-file failure isolation for file/directory imports; 60s API
  timeout; Escape no longer closes the panel under an open dialog; stale
  base/document/search responses guarded; Ollama installed list loads on
  mount and base-URL change; pull busy flag reset on success; local-model
  cancel waits for the worker's abort ack (no corrupt half-downloads);
  model-cache migration skips dot-entries and never copies a target into
  itself (case-normalized on win32).

## 0.3.0 — Semantic chunking, visual captioning, Ollama & local-model management (npm release, 2026-08-19)

### Retrieval quality

- **Citations**: `knowledge_search` returns a `citations` array (Markdown
  quote + source line per hit) for the model to quote verbatim; the recall
  panel's copy button copies the full citation instead of bare text.
- **Semantic chunking** (`semanticChunk` + `semanticChunkThreshold`):
  paragraph-level segments are embedded and adjacent similar ones merged
  (length-weighted mean vector — no extra embedding pass), per-base
  overridable.
- **Local reranking**: `rerankModel: local:Xenova/bge-reranker-base` runs a
  cross-encoder in the model worker (offline); Settings → Local Models gains
  the BGE Reranker Base card and the suggestion list offers the local option.
- **Code-fence chunk protection**: fenced code blocks (``` / ~~~) never
  split at internal blank lines or heading-like lines.
- **Token-budget chunk refinement** (`chunkTokenLimit`): oversized chunks
  split at preferred boundaries (blank line → 。/！/？ → ， → space).
- **Multi-query retrieval** (`extraQueries`): each phrasing searches
  independently and hits merge by chunk id keeping the best score.
- **Vector lane in-memory cache**: decoded embeddings stay resident per base
  (Float32Array, exact per-doc/per-base invalidation) — repeated searches no
  longer re-fetch/re-decode the BLOBs.
- **RAG-style evaluation** (`scripts/eval-rag.mjs`): Hit@k + sentence-level
  Context Recall (RAGAS-style approximation, no LLM) + MRR against golden
  answers.

### Import & document processing

- **Image/table captioning** (`imageCaptionProvider: openai|ollama`): embedded
  PDF figures (size-filtered, ≤20 per document) are described by a vision
  model and appended to the text — charts become searchable. OpenAI-compatible
  vision API or a local Ollama VLM.
- **Same-name conflict strategies** (`conflictStrategy`, default rename):
  rename (auto `_1` suffix) / replace / keep; per-request `conflict: detect`
  raises a conflict error (HTTP 409).
- **Scheduled URL auto-refresh** (`urlRefreshHours`): stale URL documents are
  re-fetched and re-indexed on an hourly sweep.
- **Parse hardening**: per-glyph math text layers are reassembled from glyph
  coordinates; corrupt-encoding layers fall back to render+OCR; SQLite
  `busy_timeout` fixes "database is locked".

### Local models & Ollama

- **Configurable model cache directory** with native folder picker
  (`ctx.workspaces.pickDirectory`), open-in-file-manager, and **migration**:
  existing models move to the new location (rename, copy+delete across
  drives; worker released first for Windows file locks) and the config
  switches over — no re-downloads, no blind C-drive growth.
- **Ollama model management**: pull with streamed progress + cancel, delete
  (two-step confirm), installed-model chips, embedding/vision recommendations,
  and clear install guidance (ollama.com/download).
- **Download reliability**: worker progress messages throttled (250ms) so a
  585MB download cannot starve the host's HTTP/UI work; Ollama pull streams
  through an AbortController; a leaked rejection in the pull cleanup chain
  (unhandledRejection killing the whole DSH process) is fixed and every void
  promise chain audited.

### Housekeeping

- Emoji replaced with lucide icons (ISC, paths from lucide-static) — Cherry
  Studio's icon library, no new dependency.
- Stale `docs/compare-with-cherry.md` removed from the repo and the npm
  tarball.

### Bug fixes (pre-open-source audit, 14 issues)

- Per-base config overrides for `semanticChunk`, `chunkTokenLimit`,
  `conflictStrategy`, MinerU and image-captioning settings were silently
  stripped by the durable schema on save — the override vanished after a
  refresh. The base-config schema now mirrors `BaseConfig` exactly.
- "Move to 未分组" never persisted: the client sent `group: undefined`,
  which JSON serialization drops; it now sends `''` and the server also
  tolerates `null` from other clients (was a `null.trim()` 500).
- `knowledge_delete_document` / `knowledge_reindex_document` ignored their
  `baseId` argument and never checked the enabled invocation scope; they now
  validate the document's owning base and scope like every other tool.
- Renaming a base into a brand-new group left an orphan group that owned
  bases but was absent from the sidebar list; the group is now registered.
- Reindexing a whole base while an import was running aborted the entire
  sweep on the first in-flight document; busy rows are now skipped
  (Cherry's `REINDEX_ALLOWED_STATUSES` semantics).
- Eval scripts printed `NaN%` on an empty eval set; they now exit with a
  clear message.

## 0.2.2 — Cherry-parity import pipeline + worker-thread local models (npm release)

### Whole-library PDF quality audit + parse decision tree (later addition)

A full audit of every imported document (223 docs) found three distinct PDF
failure modes and one SQLite concurrency bug; the parse pipeline now handles
each:

- **Fragmented text layers are no longer imported blindly.** pdf-parse's
  bundled old pdf.js fragments per-glyph-laid-out math PDFs into one "line"
  per glyph (avg line ≈ 1–5 chars) and corrupt-encoding layers yield junk
  sequences. The new decision tree measures the extracted text's line health:
  healthy (avg ≥ 5) → keep; per-glyph math → reassemble true lines from
  glyph coordinates via the new pdfjs (`getTextContent` items carry their
  transform matrix; y-clustering + x-sort, the same reassembly Cherry applies
  to OCR boxes); still junk (avg < 12 after reassembly) → render + OCR;
  only then anydoc, then the fragmented original as the last resort.
- **Corrupt-encoding text layers now OCR instead of indexing garbage** (e.g.
  a journal PDF whose glyph mapping read `L PE T R t)1 U M R…` now imports
  the rendered page's OCR text: "炼油技术与工程…摘要：提出了--种混合模拟退火
  算法…").
- **SQLite `database is locked` on concurrent writes fixed**: the chunk store
  never set `busy_timeout` (SQLite default 0), so a write that met another
  connection's lock failed instantly instead of waiting. Now `PRAGMA
  busy_timeout = 5000` (two documents in the library had failed embeddings
  from this).
- **Verified against the real library**: 马尔科夫链模型.pdf (vector-drawn,
  281 glyph-fragment chunks → renders cleanly), 基于逻辑模拟退火法的炼油厂…
  (corrupt text layer, 554 × 7-char chunks → OCRs to readable paragraphs),
  plus the earlier JBIG2 scan fix. Documents already imported with bad text
  must be re-imported to benefit (the stored text is what it was).

### Scanned/vector PDF OCR — full-page rendering (later addition to this release)

- **PDFs whose pages are vector-drawn instead of embedded rasters now OCR
  correctly.** Many textbook PDFs (e.g. mathematical lecture notes) draw the
  body with subsetted fonts and embed only decorative fragments (rule lines,
  isolated formula glyphs); pdf-parse/anydoc extract nothing and the old
  embedded-raster extraction OCR'd those fragments into single-character
  noise (one "chunk" per glyph, hundreds of micro-chunks per document).
- **Pages are now rendered with mupdf (Artifex' WASM build) at ~216dpi**
  (Cherry's pdfPageOcr posture) and the full-page raster is OCR'd, so
  vector-only pages produce coherent line text. pdfjs's CanvasGraphics
  rendering onto @napi-rs/canvas crashes the process (native incompatibility),
  hence mupdf: pure WASM, no native code, no canvas globals. pdfjs remains
  only for the embedded-raster extraction fallback (no renderer available).
- **Verified against a real 40-page Markov-chain lecture PDF**: 8 pages OCR
  in ~5s with clean paragraphs ("马尔可夫链模型" / "描述一类重要的系统
  （过程）的模型 …"), where the old path produced 281 single-character
  chunks from the first ~5 pages and nothing after.

### Bug-fix round (later additions to this release)

- **Local-model worker could be killed mid-download**: the 60s idle-release
  timer fired while a model download/load was still running (progress
  messages never reset it), terminating the worker and failing the request —
  a 585MB first download is guaranteed to hit this. Progress reports now
  keep the timer alive, and the timer never fires while a request is
  in-flight.
- **A failed local-model load was cached forever**: `getExtractor` kept the
  rejected promise, so every later request failed until the model was
  removed; failures are now dropped from the cache and retried.
- **Symbol-only search queries crashed retrieval**: `MATCH ''` is an FTS5
  syntax error, so searching `!!!` returned HTTP 500; such queries now route
  to the safe LIKE scan. Regression-tested in a new `chunkdb.spec.ts`.
- **Cancel-then-redownload of a local model was blocked**: the cancellation
  marker never expired, so re-downloading the same model always failed;
  markers now auto-expire.
- **Model deletion could fail on Windows file locks**: the worker's release
  ack is now awaited (with a grace timeout) before the cache directory is
  removed.
- **`normalizeRgba` could misclassify single-channel grayscale as 1-bit**:
  branch order hardened (pdfjs's decoded layout varies with raster size —
  RGBA for small images, RGB for larger grayscale, bit-packed for 1-bit).
- **Tests never exercised the real pdfjs decode path**: the synthetic scanned
  PDFs were byte-corrupt (latin1→UTF-8 inflation), so OCR tests only hit the
  gate; the builder now concatenates raw bytes and new tests decode real
  rasters through pdfjs (8-bit grayscale and 1-bit both verified).
- **Oversized uploads failed with an opaque server error**: files above
  ~24MB (the 32MB JSON body cap after base64) are now pre-checked client-side
  with a clear message in both the file picker and directory import paths.

### Installability hardening + OCR mirror (later additions to this release)

- **Zero-basis install fixes**: the tarball no longer declares peer
  dependencies (`@deepseek-ai/*`, react, zod are all injected by the DSH
  host as externals; declaring them made pnpm's auto-install-peers resolve
  `@deepseek-ai/dsh-tools` → `@deepseek-ai/dsh-type-meta`, which does not
  exist on the public registry and broke fresh installs). The Windows
  `@napi-rs/canvas-win32-x64-msvc` platform package moved to
  `optionalDependencies` so Linux/macOS installs no longer hit platform
  rejection. Verified end-to-end: a clean profile-style pnpm install
  (`nodeLinker: hoisted`, `autoInstallPeers: false`) with the documented
  `allowBuilds` exits 0 and the bundle registers.
- **OCR model mirror configurable**: the PaddleOCR download now honors the
  `hfEndpoint` setting (default hf-mirror.com), so users outside China can
  point it at `https://huggingface.co` like the embedding model.

### OCR for scanned PDFs (later additions to this release)

- **Local OCR engine — PaddleOCR (PP-OCRv5 mobile, full Chinese dictionary)**
  with Tesseract.js as fallback, both inside a dedicated worker thread.
  Scanned PDFs (no text layer) are recognized automatically once the models
  are downloaded (~25MB, Settings → Local Models). PP-OCRv6's ONNX repos
  ship a symbol-only dictionary (no CJK), so v5 mobile is the practical
  Chinese-capable choice. Image preprocessing (grayscale → normalize →
  sharpen, 2x upscale) mirrors Cherry's chain; CJK inter-glyph spaces are
  collapsed; JBIG2/CCITT 1-bit bitmaps are unpacked correctly (scanner
  scans).
- **MinerU remote document processor** (Cherry's `mineru` file processor):
  optional per-base/global setting routes PDFs through the MinerU API
  (batch task → signed upload → poll → result zip → Markdown) for the best
  scanned/complex-layout quality; any API failure falls back to the local
  pipeline (parsers → OCR), so a misconfigured remote never blocks imports.
- **Embedding-model change routes** (Cherry's `resolveEmbeddingModelChangeRoute`):
  an empty base saves directly; a BM25-only base gaining a model backfills
  vectors in place; switching an already-configured model is refused with
  rebuild guidance (restore carries the new model config).
- PDFs preview in an embedded viewer (native browser viewer via blob URL);
  drag & drop upload; directory imports filter unsupported formats/hidden
  entries; embedding vector-width guard; reindex skips in-flight rows;
  download failures surface visibly.

### (Original 0.2.2 entry below)

The import path is rebuilt around Cherry Studio's architecture (verified
against its source), and local-model inference moves off the main process.

- **Uncapped directory imports**: the folder picker no longer truncates to
  the 20-item interactive-file limit (Cherry imports a directory as one
  source with no cap); the 20 limit now applies to file/note picks only,
  with a "too many files" hint. The import failure dialog is gone — failed
  imports keep their row, marked red with the reason (Cherry's failed items),
  reindexable from the raw copy.
- **Cherry-style parallel import**: `addFileDocument` creates the row and
  returns immediately; parse+ingest runs on a per-base worker pool
  (concurrency 5, Cherry's `defaultConcurrency`), rows flip
  parsing → embedding x% → completed/failed via the existing status poll.
  Dedup check + first persist run under a per-base write lock so concurrent
  identical imports cannot both pass.
- **Local embedding in a dedicated worker thread** (Cherry's "in its own
  worker" `InferenceServiceBase`): transformers.js and its ~600MB model run
  off the main process — a large import batch can no longer freeze the host
  (previously the in-process model plus 5 concurrent parses exceeded the
  main heap and froze the whole web instance). Serialized inference in the
  worker, request/response ids with timeout, 60s idle release of the loaded
  model, crash → fail in-flight + respawn, `unref()` so the worker never
  blocks shutdown; proxy + HF mirror honoured inside the worker.
- **Download failures are visible**: a background model download/load
  failure lands in the status map (`error` + reason) instead of being
  swallowed, so the Local Models panel shows why a download did not start.
- **Cherry-detail pass**: drag & drop upload onto the document list (the
  hint existed, the handlers did not); directory imports filter unsupported
  formats and hidden entries up front (Cherry's directory scan) with a
  "skipped N" toast; server-side extension whitelist rejects binaries
  before a row is created; embedding vector-width guard (Cherry's
  `assertEmbeddingVectors`) prevents a switched model from corrupting cosine
  search; reindex skips in-flight rows (Cherry's `REINDEX_ALLOWED_STATUSES`)
  with visible counts; `.mdx` joins the supported formats.
- Retrieval behavior and eval baselines are unchanged.

## 0.2.12 — Remove real eval sets (privacy)

The four real evaluation sets (`eval-questions.json`, `eval-rephrase.json`,
`eval-extra.json`, `eval-base22.json`) were built from private study
materials, so they are removed from the repo and its history. The runner
(`scripts/eval-retrieval.mjs`) and the example template
(`scripts/eval-questions.example.json`) remain, so anyone can build their own
sets. Run `node scripts/eval-retrieval.mjs --file your-set.json --base <id>`.

## 0.2.11 — Security hardening (SSRF, path traversal, zip bombs)

Audit-driven hardening of the import paths:

- **SSRF guard on URL import**: `fetchHtml` now refuses non-http(s) protocols
  and loopback / link-local / RFC1918 private hosts (`127.0.0.0/8`,
  `10.x`, `172.16–31.x`, `192.168.x`, `169.254.x`, `0.x`, `localhost`,
  `[::1]`, `metadata.google.internal`, …) before any request is sent. The
  `knowledge_import_url` tool and the URL refresh path share the guard.
- **Redirect re-validation**: fetch no longer follows redirects implicitly —
  `httpFetch` accepts a `redirect: 'manual'` policy and `fetchHtml` walks up
  to 5 hops itself, validating every hop's protocol and host. A public page
  can no longer 302 to an internal address to bypass the check.
- **Path-traversal depth**: `RawFileStorage.deleteBase` now validates its
  `baseId` through the same boundary as every other raw path (a tampered
  domain record could previously have driven `rm -rf` outside the raw root).
- **Zip-bomb guard**: office archives (docx/pptx/xlsx/epub) whose declared
  uncompressed size exceeds 256 MB are rejected before any entry is inflated.
- **Route segment decoding**: `/knowledge/*` path segments are
  `decodeURIComponent`-decoded so encoded ids resolve like the JSON API.
- Retrieval behavior is unchanged; eval baselines are identical.

## 0.2.10 — Extended retrieval eval sets

Two new real eval sets join the original 24 questions:

- **`scripts/eval-extra.json`** (16 questions, base 11): covers documents the
  original set did not touch (偏最小二乘回归 / 随机模拟与系统仿真 /
  微分方程建模), plus harder variants of covered topics (Little 定律, 生灭过程,
  CR 一致性检验, 0-1 背包, Kruskal, 允许缺货, Leslie 矩阵, EDD 规则, …).
  Baseline: hybrid Hit@5 0.938 vs lexical 0.778 — the vector lane bridges
  another +0.16 over the extra questions. Two stub documents with 0 chunks
  (计算机仿真 / 数学建模算法, empty imports) are noted in the set and not
  tested; the Leslie question is a known semantic gap (the term never appears
  in the 差分方程 document).
- **`scripts/eval-base22.json`** (6 questions, base 22): retrieval of the
  writing-guide documents (math-model-writing) and data corpora (oil.csv /
  holidays_events.csv / ensemble_log.txt). The three writing questions hit
  1.0 in every mode; the three data questions fail in every mode — a real
  property of tabular/CSV retrieval (numeric cells carry no semantic text),
  kept as a documented known gap.

No runtime behavior changed.

## 0.2.9 — Space reclamation after large deletes (Cherry's reclaimSpace)

Deleting documents no longer leaves the freed pages stranded in the chunk
store file. `ChunkDatabase.reclaimSpace` mirrors Cherry's `reclaimSpace` +
driver thresholds:

- **WAL checkpoint first** (cheap; folds the delete's committed frees into
  the main file so `freelist_count` reflects them).
- **Threshold-gated VACUUM**: only when the freelist is ≥20% of the file AND
  ≥8 MB — a small delete never pays for a whole-file rewrite whose pages a
  later index would reuse anyway.
- **FTS 'optimize' before the VACUUM**: the external-content trigram index
  only TOMBSTONES its rows on delete; the dead segment blobs linger in the
  shadow table, which VACUUM cannot reclaim on its own.
- **Reclaim after delete**: `deleteBase`, `deleteDocument`, and
  `deleteDocuments` call it synchronously; the thresholds keep the common
  case a no-op. Memory-backed stores skip it.
- Retrieval behavior is unchanged; eval baselines are identical.

## 0.2.8 — Multi-model local embedding registry

The Settings → Local Models page now offers five download-ready in-process
models instead of one, and each model gets the pooling strategy its family
requires — Cherry Studio's `pooling.ts` posture, previously hardcoded to
Qwen3's last-token pooling.

- **Registry**: `onnx-community/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B-ONNX` (1024-dim, zh,
  last-token), `Xenova/bge-small-zh-v1.5` (512-dim, zh, CLS),
  `Xenova/bge-small-en-v1.5` (384-dim, en, CLS), `Xenova/gte-small` (384-dim,
  multilingual, mean), `Xenova/multilingual-e5-small` (384-dim, multilingual,
  mean). Every entry is a real, downloadable transformers.js ONNX repo.
- **Per-family pooling** (`poolingFor`): Qwen3 → last-token, BGE/BCE → CLS,
  GTE/E5/unknown → mean — a BGE model previously produced wrong vectors under
  the hardcoded last-token pooling.
- **Suggestions synced**: the settings combobox's local list mirrors the
  registry exactly, so every suggestion is actually downloadable.
- The default model and its pooling are unchanged, so existing embeddings and
  eval baselines are identical.

## 0.2.7 — Metadata-filtered search

Search can now be narrowed to a document subset by metadata — a capability
neither Cherry Studio's search nor the reference implementation offers
(Cherry's `metadata` is output-only; its search is scoped by base alone).

- **`filter` on search requests**: `docIds`, `titleIncludes` (case-insensitive
  substring), `sourceTypes` (file / text / url / directory), and
  `updatedAfter` / `updatedBefore` (epoch ms) — all optional, ANDed.
- **Resolved once into a doc-id allow-list** shared by both retrieval paths:
  the SQL lanes push `doc_id IN (...)` into the FTS5 / vector queries (bounded
  to SQLite's parameter limit), and the in-memory fallback filters candidates.
  A filter that matches nothing returns zero hits.
- **Exposed** in the `knowledge_search` tool parameters (`docIds`,
  `titleIncludes`, `sourceTypes`, `updatedAfter`, `updatedBefore`), the HTTP
  `/search` route, and the browser panel types.
- Retrieval ranking is untouched; eval baselines are identical.

## 0.2.6 — Directory subtree operations (Cherry's outermost-root folding)

Batch operations now understand the directory tree. `deleteDocuments` and
`reindexDocuments` fold their selection to the outermost roots first —
Cherry's `getOutermostSelectedItemIds` semantics — so a directory plus one of
its descendants in the same batch is handled once, and each selected
directory operates on its whole subtree recursively.

- **Subtree delete**: `deleteDocuments` removes a selected directory and
  everything below it (chunks + raw files + rows), instead of leaving orphaned
  descendants behind.
- **Subtree reindex**: `reindexDocument` on a directory container recursively
  reindexes its descendants; `reindexDocuments` and `reindexBase` fold the
  selection so no document is reindexed twice (a directory's children are
  covered by the directory itself).
- **New tool `knowledge_reindex_document`**: re-index one document or a whole
  directory subtree (Cherry's `refreshConcepts` counterpart) — re-reads the
  raw source, re-chunks, and re-embeds only what changed.
- Retrieval behavior is unchanged; eval baselines are identical.

## 0.2.5 — URL snapshots with refresh

URL documents now keep a persisted snapshot of the fetched text (Cherry's
snapshot model): the base owns a stable copy, reindex re-reads it, and
refresh re-fetches the page and updates the snapshot + index in place.

- **Snapshot on import**: `addUrlDocument` persists the fetched text as
  `<baseId>/<docId>.md` in the raw store (`rawFilePath`), so a URL document is
  rebuildable from its snapshot and crash recovery covers the fetch/parse
  window like any file import.
- **Refresh**: `refreshUrlDocument` re-fetches the page; when the text (or
  title) changed it overwrites the snapshot and re-indexes — hash reuse
  re-embeds only the chunks that changed. An unchanged page or a failed fetch
  leaves the current snapshot and index untouched; refresh never degrades.
- **Surface**: `POST /knowledge/documents/:id/refresh`, the
  `knowledge_refresh_url` tool (returns `changed: false` for no-op), and a
  "刷新快照" action on URL document rows in the panel.
- **Bug fix**: the in-memory store's `putChunks` now mirrors the SQLite
  replace semantics (drop the document's old rows first) — a reindex in a
  memory-backed profile no longer leaves stale chunks searchable.
- Retrieval behavior is unchanged; eval baselines are identical.

## 0.2.4 — Raw source storage (Cherry's "import means copy")

Uploaded file documents now keep their original bytes — Cherry's `raw/`
material store, adapted to the plugin layout: `<chunkStoreDir>/knowledge-raw/
<baseId>/<docId><ext>`, with the base-relative path recorded on the document
(`rawFilePath`).

- **Import means copy**: the base owns a stable copy of every uploaded file;
  deleting the document removes it, `deleteBase` sweeps the whole base's
  directory, and restore copies the bytes across so a restored base stays
  rebuildable from source.
- **Reindex from source**: `reindexDocument` re-reads and re-parses the raw
  bytes first (a parser upgrade now actually improves extraction on reindex),
  falling back to the stored text and then to reconstructed chunks when the
  file is gone — a reindex never wipes vectors for an unrebuildable source.
  This is Cherry's `canKnowledgeItemRebuildSource` posture, made simpler by
  the plugin's atomic overwrite writes (no delete-then-rebuild window).
- **Crash recovery from the file**: a placeholder that only holds a raw file
  (crash before/during parse) is now resumed from source instead of dropped —
  the same recoverability Cherry gets from its `raw/` copy.
- **Download route**: `GET /knowledge/documents/:id/raw` streams the original
  bytes (attachment, original mime type).
- Retrieval behavior is unchanged; eval baselines are identical.

## 0.2.3 — Sibling-chunk context on search hits

Each search hit now carries its surrounding chunks (`siblingContext`,
±`siblingChunks` in the same document, in reading order, heading-prefixed) —
the full paragraph a RAG answer needs, instead of a bare chunk that often
cuts a sentence mid-way. Cherry Studio returns only the single chunk body,
so this is an enhancement over the reference implementation.

- **New setting `siblingChunks`** (0–3, default 1, 0 = off) in Settings and
  per-base config: how many neighbouring chunks (±) to attach to each hit.
- **One bounded SQL query** per hit (`listChunksByIndexRange`) — no full
  document scan, works on the SQLite-backed store and the in-memory fallback.
- **Exposed everywhere the hit is**: `SearchResult.hits[].siblingContext` in
  the HTTP API, the `knowledge_search` tool schema, its text render (context
  before the hit, `>>>` marker), and the browser panel types.
- Retrieval ranking is untouched; eval baselines are identical.

## 0.2.2 — Crash-resumable imports (internal iteration, not published to npm)

A crash mid-embedding no longer loses the document. `ingestDocument` now
persists the document (with its source text, marked `incomplete`) BEFORE
embedding starts, and `buildChunks` lands every finished embedding batch into
the chunk store as it completes (`putChunkBatch`, an incremental upsert that
does not clear the document's other rows). On the next start, startup recovery
reports interrupted documents instead of dropping them, and the service
automatically resumes each one: hash reuse (0.2.1) re-embeds only the batches
that never landed, so a multi-hour PDF import interrupted at 60% resumes from
60% — no re-upload, no full re-embed.

- **Incremental batch persistence**: `ChunkDatabase.putChunkBatch` (upsert by
  chunk id, rowid-stable `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` so the FTS trigger chain stays
  consistent) — the crash-recovery write path used by both import and reindex.
- **Interrupted-document recovery**: `recoverInterruptedImports` now returns
  `{ removed, resume }` — `removed` stays the pure placeholders with no
  recoverable text (parse crashed before the source was persisted); `resume`
  lists documents holding rawText that were `incomplete` when the process
  died. The service re-indexes them in the background after startup.
- **Resumable reindex**: `reindexDocument` marks the document incomplete while
  it rebuilds, so a crash during reindex is recovered the same way.
- Retrieval behavior is unchanged; eval baselines are identical.

## 0.2.1 — Library-wide embedding reuse (Cherry's decision A4)

Re-embedding unchanged text no longer re-spends the embedding API. Each chunk
row now persists `embedding_text_hash` (sha256 of the exact search text the
embedding model sees), and `buildChunks` asks the store which of the new
chunk hashes already have a vector under the current embedding model before
calling the API — only the missing hashes are embedded.

- **Library-wide reuse**: a reindex, a chunk-size change, or a fresh import of
  text already indexed elsewhere (same base, another base, or the same
  document) reuses the stored vector whenever `(hash, embedding_model)` matches
  — the same dedup Cherry Studio gets from its `embedding` table keyed by
  `embedding_text_hash`. The model is part of the key because one chunk store
  can serve several bases with different models, so a hash alone is not a valid
  reuse key.
- **Automatic migration**: on first start after upgrade, the `embedding_text_hash`
  column is added and backfilled for every stored vector from its `search_text`
  (idempotent; ~3k vectors backfill in well under a second). The hash index is
  created after the column exists, so an older store opens cleanly.
- **No behavior change to retrieval**: reuse only affects which vectors are
  *computed*, not what is stored or searched; eval baselines are unchanged.

## 0.2.0 — SQLite chunk store + SQL retrieval (scale fix)

Chunk data moved out of the durable domain (`json` backend, which atomically
rewrote the whole unit file on every write — deletion and import slowed as
data grew) into a dedicated SQLite file (Node's built-in `node:sqlite`) where
every chunk put/delete is a single statement. This mirrors Cherry Studio's
design: business state (bases, documents, runtime config) stays in the domain,
the chunk index lives in its own engine.

- **Chunk storage**: one row per chunk in `<DSH_HOME>/storages/knowledge-chunks.sqlite` (configurable via `chunkStorePath`); embeddings stored as little-endian float32 BLOBs (Cherry's A1). Delete a document/base = one statement regardless of chunk count.
- **SQL retrieval lanes** (Cherry's FTS5 + brute-force vector posture): the lexical lane runs an external-content **FTS5 trigram** index (BM25 scoring in SQL, with CJK trigram windowing and a LIKE fallback for terms a trigram index cannot see); the vector lane scans the scope's stored BLOBs at query time. Hybrid search fuses both lanes with Reciprocal Rank Fusion. The in-memory JS rank path remains as the fallback for stores without SQL lanes.
- **Bounded reads**: nothing is loaded into memory at open; document lists, stats, and search run bounded SQL queries, so resident memory no longer scales with the corpus.
- **Automatic migration**: on first start after upgrade, chunks still stored in the legacy `knowledge.json` unit are moved into the SQLite store (duplicate rows from an interrupted earlier migration are dropped), and the previous per-document bundle layout is converted to per-chunk rows; the JSON unit then trims itself on the next write.
- **Parse/embedding status**: during import the file row appears immediately with live 解析中 / 嵌入中 NN% status, and folder rows show 导入中 while any descendant is processing.

## 0.1.0 (initial release)

A Cherry Studio-style knowledge base as a standalone, open-source bundle plugin for DeepSeek Harness (DSH).

### Features

- **Knowledge bases & groups**: create / rename / delete bases, grouped sidebar navigation with collapsible sections, move-to-group, and group create / rename / delete.
- **Documents**: add text, upload files (txt / md / csv / html / json / pdf / docx / pptx / xlsx / epub, multi-file drag-drop), import a URL, or import a whole directory; same-name conflict resolution (keep all / replace); content-hash dedup; per-document ready/not-embedded status and relative update time.
- **Chunking**: heading-aware smart chunking with configurable size / overlap / separator, with the document title + heading path injected as retrieval context.
- **Embeddings**: OpenAI-compatible endpoints, Ollama, an in-process local model (transformers.js, default `onnx-community/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B-ONNX`), or lexical-only fallback (CJK bigram + latin BM25).
- **Retrieval**: BM25 + vector hybrid with Reciprocal Rank Fusion, MMR diversity, optional rerank (Jina / SiliconFlow / Cohere v2 style APIs), search modes (auto / hybrid / vector / lexical), and a score threshold; recall test with highlighted match snippets, per-hit vector/lexical scores, latency, and replayable history.
- **Local model manager**: a Settings → "Local Models" page with download / cancel / remove / retry and a live progress bar; configurable cache directory (`localModelCacheDir`).
- **Management panel**: a sidebar-foot entry opening a frame-wide Cherry Studio-style page (source list as a table with multi-select bulk reindex/delete, recall test, and per-base rag settings), plus model-id suggestion comboboxes.
- **Model tools**: `knowledge_search`, `knowledge_list_bases`, `knowledge_create_base`, `knowledge_delete_base`, `knowledge_add_document`, `knowledge_list_documents`, `knowledge_delete_document`, `knowledge_import_url`, `knowledge_stats`, `knowledge_get_document`, `knowledge_reindex_base`.

### Persistence

Business state (bases, documents, runtime config) is durable through DSH's
`storageDomain` seam (`json` backend), falling back to in-memory when no
storage backend is available. Chunks live in a dedicated SQLite file
(`<DSH_HOME>/storages/knowledge-chunks.sqlite`).
